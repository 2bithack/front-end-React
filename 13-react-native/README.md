## General Debugging and logging

React Native is using the simulator but not generally running in a development
environment. Most the code is run via JS. This makes debugging a problem. 

In the simulator use command+d to open the menu. Choose: Debug JS Remotely. 
This will send console and error messages to Chrome. You'll need to open 
Chrome and open the console. 

Compilation errors will show in the simulator, while run time errors will
end up in the console.
