# Webpack Intro

Webpack is a "module bundler". webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets 
representing those modules. In other words Webpack preprocesses your files and combines them into
fewer files that will run your web app.

## Webpack React Challenge

Once you've worked through the Webpack tutorial test our your Webpack installation by rebuilding one 
of the earlier projects in the Webpack project. To get the most out this you will use a modified 
strategy to managing your components. Instead of placing them all in the same file you will create a 
.js or .jsx file for each component. Notice this done in the last tutorial!
