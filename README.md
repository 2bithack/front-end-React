# Front React

These are notes for a frontend React class. At the moment these are just rough ideas which will 
take shape over the next couple weeks.

### Why Learn React?

Why React is a popular forward thinking framework. React is an evolution of the MVC architecture 
that is common in many programming languages. 

React is about building user interfaces from reusable components. 

Expect to see React at some larger companies you may work for. 

React uses ES6 the latest iteration of the JavaScript language. Learning React is a great way to 
expand your knowledge of JavaScript.

## Goals

**This class will take the form of lessons that students can follow at their own pace.** Rather than
weekly course material. All of the material will be present at the beginning of the course. Students 
will be encouraged to work through the material in sections. Each section will be followed up by a 
series of challenges. Students can self assess their own knowledge of the material by solving the 
challenges. 

__Ideally students will solve all of the challenges before moving on to a new section!__

- Own and apply the Reactive data flow.
- Build components.
- Create single page applications with React.
- Use open source components. 
- Use React Router to create multipage sites.
- Use React Redux to manage application state. 

## Projects

- React, ES6, JSX
    - Tutorial project Tic Tac Toe, Concentration game.
- Redux
    - Weather App
- Challenges stretch goals
    - Apply Velocity-React
    - Add some logic to game
    - Use another API

## Rough Outline

This is choose you own adventure class. Start at the beginning and work through the course material. 
If you feel comfortable that you understand it test yourself by completing the challeneges at the 
end of that section. 

Following the basic material is a section there are projects to build. Finish each of these to a 
level of completion that you feel good about. 

- Intro React tutorial tic tac toe.
- Matching game (Don't use a timer to close matches instead two open tiles that don't match close 
when the next tile is opened) 
- Weather app.
- Use another API.
- Use some React components to display things in new and interesting ways!
- Make a multipage site with React-router.
- Application State with Redux.
