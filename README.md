# Front React

These are notes for a frontend React class. At the moment these are just rough ideas which will 
take shape over the next couple weeks. 

### Why Learn React?

Why React is a popular forward thinking framework. React is an evolution of the MVC architecture 
that is common in many programming languages. 

React is about building user interfaces from reusable components. 

Expect to see React at some larger companies you may work for. 

React uses ES6 the latest iteration of the JavaScript language. Learning React is a great way to 
expand your knowledge of JavaScript.
